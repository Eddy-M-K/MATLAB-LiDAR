# MATLAB-LiDAR

This repository includes MATLAB code for the simulation of the Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor as well as algorithms for finding the intersections of the emitted lasers with triangles and golf balls. Intersections with golf balls are calculated through generation of a golf ball's trajectory under situations such as gravity, drag, lift.

Credit for the logic implemented within Drag.m, Lift.m, Both.m, and Gravity.m which are files used to generate a golf ball's trajectory, go to UW Chemical Engineering Student Rama Al-Enzy.

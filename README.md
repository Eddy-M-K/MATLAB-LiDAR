# MATLAB-LiDAR

This repository includes MATLAB code for the simulation of the Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor as well as algorithms for finding the intersections of the emitted lasers with triangles and golf balls.

Credit for the logic implemented within Drag.m, Lift.m, Both.m, and Gravity.m which are files used to generate a golf ball's trajectory, go to ramaal-enzy.
